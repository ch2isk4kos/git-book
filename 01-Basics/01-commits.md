# Git: Basics

## Commits

A **commit** in a git repository records a snapshot of all (tracked) files in a directory. Think of it like how you copy & paste things from one location to another.

Git doesn't blindly copy the entire repository each time you commit. It compresses a commit - when possible - as a set of changes - **delta** - from one version of the repo to another.

Git maintains a history of all changes that have ever been made to a repository.
